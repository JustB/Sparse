# Sparse
A collection of functions for working with Sparse Matrices

This repository contains three functions for working with Sparse Matrices.

1.  ScalarTimesSparse
2.  SparseTimesVector
3.  VectorTimesSparse

It also contains unit tests for each of those functions
1.  TEST_ScalarTimesSparse
2.  TEST_SparseTimesVector
3.  TEST_VectorTimesSparse

The unit tests also serve as examples for how to use the functions.

To run all the unit tests, put all the files in the current Matlab directory and execute the command "runtests".
